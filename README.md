<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p>Firstly, we determine our intended audience for this website. As such, we are putting ourselves into their shoes as a user. To be able to ask ourselves questions like why would they need or use our website for?</p>

<ul>
  <li>As a mask donater, I would like to know how the product is able to protect others from this Covid-19 virus. I need information about the Covid-19 status around the world if I really care to help and stop this pandemic. I need to be able to see the progress when I am helping the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>As our website is only available for mobile users, we only need to develop and focus on the mobile version of the website. Before that, we were already building up the prototype version of the mobile website. This ensures that we have a proper planning before developing it.</p>
